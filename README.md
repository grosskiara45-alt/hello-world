# hello-world
My name is Kiara Gross. I am 24 years old and am interested in gaining a job in web development and web design. I went to college for filmmaking, where we made portfolio websites and have a little bit of experience with HTML and CSS through college and my current job but I would love to expand on that and work within the world of tech.
